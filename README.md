# SlimbookRGBKeyboard
This is a template to customize your keyboard lights, I just mapped the positions, so you just need to change the RGB color value to create your on custom design.

So you just need to download and edit the template file and then move it to this folder... probably "/usr/share/slimbookrgbkeyboard/src/animations", or wherever you have the SlimbookRGBKeyboard animations folder. You'll propably need to move it with the help of the beloved terminal, with sudo.
